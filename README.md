Test project on Stepic.org platform - cellular automaton. A cellular automaton (pl. cellular automata, abbrev. CA) 
is a discrete model of computation studied in automata theory. Cellular 
automata are also called cellular spaces, tessellation automata, homogeneous
structures, cellular structures, tessellation structures, and iterative 
arrays. Cellular automata have found application in various areas, including
physics, theoretical biology and microstructure modeling.
